My name is David Guida, I was born in Italy in 1982 and I live in Montreal, Quebec, with my beautiful wife, two hurricane kids and a ginger cat.

I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft during the day and a plethora of other things at night. Sometimes I even manage to stop for a bit and relax.

Normally, when I'm not busy coding, you can find me in my kitchen baking cakes.
