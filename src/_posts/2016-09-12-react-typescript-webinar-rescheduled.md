Due to the huge amount of registrations, me and the folks at <a href="http://www.indiamentor.com/" target="_blank">Indiamentors</a> have decided to postpone the Introduction to React & Typescript webinar to Saturday September 17th at 6:30 IST .

As I <a href="http://www.davidguida.net/react-typescript-webinar/" target="_blank">told you before</a>, this webinar is going to be an introduction about React,  how to setup your dev environment and how to write your first piece of React code.  
I&#8217;ll show you a small demo and at the end we&#8217;re going to have a nice Q&A session.

Here&#8217;s the agenda:

  * Why React?
  * Let’s get started!
  * React Components
  * Properties and State
  * Webpack
  * Demo

Make sure <a href="http://www.indiamentor.com/events/introduction-react-typescript" target="_blank">to register </a>and reserve your seat!
