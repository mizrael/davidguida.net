<a href="http://www.davidguida.net/cqrs-on-commands-and-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last time</a> we discussed how to use the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DecoratedCommand.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorator </a>pattern to validate our Commands. The approach works fine but while using it I started feeling something strange. It can be probably considered an elegant solution but there&#8217;s something missing, like a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code smell</a>.

What is the problem? Easy: how can you tell if you are really running the validation? What if you just &#8220;forget&#8221; to register the decorator? Nah, you need it.

    Also, a better use for decorators should be all those cross cutting concerns like logging, tracing and so on.

Another very simple solution is to use a base class for the Command Handlers that takes an instance of IValidator as optional dependency and consumes it right before executing the command:

as you can see in this case the validator returns a &#8220;result&#8221; object that exposes&nbsp;a boolean status flag&nbsp;and a list of errors that may have occurred.  
If the validation fails a specific exception is thrown, containing the list of errors.

If instead everything is ok, the protected method RunCommand() is executed, and that&#8217;s the only thing you have to implement in your Command Handlers ðŸ™‚
