Too much time has passed since my last post. That&#8217;s not a good thing.  
In my defense, I spent part of this time trying to learn new stuff ðŸ™‚  
I have always had the desire to learn a little bit of electronics. Nothing specific, just basic stuff&#8230;and I tried, oh yes, I tried. Each time I feel the urge to create something, full of hopes and ideas, I go to the local shop, buy capacitors, resistors, leds and then&#8230; then nothing. What usually happens is that I pick up a tutorial, usually a very complicated one, start mounting the pieces and then something goes wrong. Since I lack the basics (and most of the theory also), I&#8217;m usually not able to understand what is broken and eventually I give up.  
No, I&#8217;m not a smart guy. 

Thankfully, the guys at <a href="http://autodesk.com" title="Autodesk" target="_blank">Autodesk</a> published a very nice website for people like me, <a href="http://123d.circuits.io/" title="123D Circuits" target="_blank">123D Circuits</a>!  
In a nutshell, it&#8217;s a circuit building and simulation tool. With it you can pick the components you want (some of the basic ones, but you can even use <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino" target="_blank">Arduino</a>) and combine them till something start working, hopefully in the way you were expecting ðŸ˜€

This time I decided to start simple, trying one piece after another BUT before placing something on the breadboard I read the specs, search the easiest tutorial and, when available, the datasheets.

Here&#8217;s one of the first experiment I made, just a couple of pushbuttons controlling two leds, but it&#8217;s a start ðŸ™‚
