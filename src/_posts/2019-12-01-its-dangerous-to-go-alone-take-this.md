15 pieces of luggage. 10 small trolleys. 5 big boxes for a total of 126 kg. A wife, two kids, parents-in-law and a cat. 2 planes, 13 hours of total flight time. 

That's what it took to change my life and the one of my loved ones.

Tomorrow is going to be my first day in this new professional life.
