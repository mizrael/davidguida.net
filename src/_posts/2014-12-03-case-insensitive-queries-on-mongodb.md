Short version: you can&#8217;t.

Long version: well&#8230;. you can&#8217;t ðŸ˜€ Or at least you can&#8217;t NOW, based on what is stated here :Â <a title="case insensitive index" href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-90" target="_blank">https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-90</a>Â .

If you really need case-insensitive queries one option is to create another field with a lowercase representation of the text, put an index on it and run your queries on this field instead.
