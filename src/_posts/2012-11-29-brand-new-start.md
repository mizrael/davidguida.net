A long time ago, I had the chance to read <a href="http://scientificninja.com/blog/write-games-not-engines" target="_blank">this post</a>. At the time I thought it was a great idea (and I still do), but I was still too focused on learning the basic principles of Computer Graphics and all the math behind the scenes.

Years have passed and day after day, I moved from videogames programming to web development (sigh).

Now I probably have the opportunity to take a step back and start again from scratch ðŸ˜€  
Thanks to <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/" target="_blank">ThreeJs</a>Â I can keep improving my Javascript skills and at the same time do something fun!

  <a href="/webGl/Test1/index.htm" target="_blank">This is</a> what I&#8217;ve accomplished in just a couple of hours (including the startup, digging through the docs, examples and so on). Of course it works only on Chrome and Firefox, so here&#8217;s a screenshot&#8230;.
