ok, this time I've focused my spare time on making Windows Forms and XNA cohesist.

[<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-297" alt="XnaWinform" src="/assets/uploads/2013/10/XnaWinform-300x178.jpg" width="300" height="178" />](/assets/uploads/2013/10/XnaWinform.jpg)

I've created a small example of how to do that and pushed everything on GitHub as [the last time ](/hexagons-part-2/ "Hexagonal Map Rendering") , you can find the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/XnaWinform" target="_blank">repository here.</a>

Basically you have to create everything by yourself, GraphicsDevice and ServicesContainer. Yeah, that can be a mess.

Oh and don't forget to set PresentationParameters.IsFullScreen to false!
