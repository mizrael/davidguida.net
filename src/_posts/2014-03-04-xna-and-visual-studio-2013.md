<a href="https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases" target="_blank">Thank you. </a>Really, thank you.

That's the link to the XNA page on <a href="https://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Codeplex</a>Â , with a package that will allow Visual Studio 2013 users to write, build and deploy XNA 4 applications.

Enjoy!

PS: yes, I'm still working on <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/CastleLegends" target="_blank">Castle Legends</a>.
