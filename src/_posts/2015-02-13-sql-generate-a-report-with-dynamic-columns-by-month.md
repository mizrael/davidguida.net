      Hi all! This time I'll try to dig a little bit into the fabulous realm of SQL and see how we can generate a nice report with dynamic columns.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The need: I had to generate a report&nbsp;showing some counts divided by month, basically the columns represent&nbsp;the months and the user has the possibility to pick a date range.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For example, imagine that you want to select the number of orders placed by all the customers by month.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Using the standard <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northwind </a>database as a reference, the first thing to do is to generate a list of months along with the relative start and end days:
    </p>

    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/mizrael/c44e575008f5ab98994f.js"></script></p>
    
    <p>
      The next step is "quite" easy: all we have to do is to generate a string containing the main query that picks all the customers and has many sub-queries, &nbsp;one for each month, SELECT-ing the count of the orders.
    </p>
    
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/mizrael/930250f0c792ff54fdc8.js"></script></p>

    <p>
      As you may see, most of the work is done with lines 5-10 where we use the <a title="COALESCE" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/ms190349.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COALESCE </a>function to concatenate the sub-queries created using the #dates temp table. Note that each query will contain a WHERE clause that filters the Order by Customer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On lines 12-13 we create the final query to be executed, and finally, on line 16 we ask&nbsp;<a title="sp_executesql" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/ms188001.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sp_executesql &nbsp;</a>to run our code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here's a screenshot of the results:

      Don't forget to DROP the #dates table! ðŸ˜€
