Ok, I did it. I made a Silverlight game.  
Actually I'm not very proud of it, but at least it was veeeeery funny to write <img alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/davideguida.netne.net/libs/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/teeth_smile.gif?w=788" data-recalc-dims="1" /> It took just a couple of hours, and I spent most of the time searching on Google for the assets (to the authors: please don't blame me. If you feel bad for the fact that I've used one of the fruits of your creativity, please, let me know. Seriously. )  
To be honest, I already had some of the sources because they were part of an old XNA project, but&#8230;  
I'm not happy of the performance, so I think I'll start it again from scratch, just for the fun of it <img alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/davideguida.netne.net/libs/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/embaressed_smile.gif?w=788" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Anyway, <a href="/games/minesweeper" target="_blank">here's the link</a>, enjoy!

Oh yes. It's a minesweeper clone. Yes, like the Windows'one. No, no flowers.
