3 months ago I wrote a <a target="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6814733419621187584/" target="_blank">post on LinkedIn</a> that made almost 45k visits in few days.
Few things happened since then and I got _slightly_ sidetracked.

It's been a while now since <a href="/blazor-file-upload-azure-blob-storage-part-3/" target="_blank">my last post</a>. Almost 3 months. 
Initially I was like "I'll just let this week pass, then I'll start blogging again". 
Then one month passed and I was not even thinking about checking the analytics. Then another month. 

I **wanted** to get back to writing, really. But all of a sudden, it felt like I had nothing else to tell the world.

I felt _drained_. 

That was the sum of all my experiences. 
Every post I published, every talk I gave, every single line of code brought me there. 
And now, finally, I was at peace. I was _whole_.

That moment of epiphany is now passed and I'm looking at things from a different perspective. I've achieved my life-long goal, just to realize that the world is mine to take as it was before.

I will blog again. I actually have some ideas already. Probably won't be as often as it used to be, but it will happen.

I am also still working on <a href="https://www.opensleigh.net" target="_blank">OpenSleigh</a>, although there I'm more in a passive mode. Waiting for users to tell me how they use the library and what they want.

Peace.
