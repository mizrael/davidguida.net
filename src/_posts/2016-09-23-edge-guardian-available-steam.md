This time I just want to spread the word about my two good friends Maurizio and Marco from <a href="http://www.hypothermicgames.com/" target="_blank">Hypotermic Games</a>, who have finally got the chance to publish their first game on Steam, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/518000" target="_blank">Edge Guardian</a> !

In a nutshell, it's an action beat-em-up for the <a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/" target="_blank">HTC Vive</a> where you'll find yourself in a cube-based world, forced to punch your way out through thousands of enemies.

I don't own an HTC Vive, but even if I haven't had the possibility to try the game, I can easily say that it's gonna be really addictive. Take a look at the gameplay if you don't trust me.

Good luck guys!
