I found a nice infographic today about how networks and the Internet have changed from the '60s.  Here's the link to the original article:

Now, I know that the first online <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/pizza-hut_n_3894981.html" target="_blank">purchase was a pizza </a>but please, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11024908/20th-anniversary-of-first-online-sale-how-we-shop-on-the-web.html" target="_blank">don't buy</a> if the website doesn't show a proper SSL certificate, please.

Cheers!
