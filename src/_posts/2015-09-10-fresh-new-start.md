I moved to Limerick, Ireland.

Moved from 28° to 14°.

Moved from a sunny place to a cloudy one.

Why? Because I got hired by <a href="http://www.dell.com" target="_blank">Dell</a>.

After 7 years in <a href="http://www.healthwareinternational.com" target="_blank">Healthware</a> I decided to move on. I needed some fresh air, some new ideas, to see something different. To see how people work in a very large environment, how they actually manage to handle big and crucial projects.

So I said goodbye to my old colleagues and friends, goodbye to <a href="http://www.videum.com" target="_blank">Videum</a> (who knows&#8230;) and here I am, with a new path in front of me.

Wish me luck!
