I am turning 34.

Yesterday I was writing my Master Thesis. I was 24.

The day before I was playing the drums at my 18th birthday party.

Now I am a father, the CTO of a small <a href="http://www.studio3pl.com" target="_blank">software company</a>, and share my days (and nights) with a beautiful woman. I am definitely not complaining, but sometimes I feel like I am missing something. Time mostly.

Time has becomeÂ slippery, acquiring momentum and now is rolling faster and faster. Every day I tell myself I need to stop and learn to take care of the little things&#8230;and every night I go to sleep cursing me for not being capable enough.

In my next life I want to be a cat.
