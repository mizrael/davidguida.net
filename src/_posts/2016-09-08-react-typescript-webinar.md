Just a quick update: thanks to my good friend <a href="http://www.indiamentor.com/mentors/lalit_kale" target="_blank">Lalit Kale</a> who invited me, I will be running a webinar this Saturday about React and Typescript.

It&#8217;s going to be an introduction about how to setup your dev environment and how to write your first piece of React code.  Absolutely no rocket science involved, we&#8217;ll discuss about pros and cons, there will be a quick demo and I&#8217;m sure it will be fun (at least for me).

It will be at 6:30pm IST . As you may have guessed, most of the audience is in India, also because I&#8217;m doing this in partnership with <a href="http://www.indiamentor.com" target="_blank">Indiamentor</a>.

<a href="http://www.indiamentor.com/events/introduction-react-typescript-saturday-10th-september-2016-06-30pm-ist" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s the link </a>for the registration.

Don&#8217;t miss it!
