I married a wonderful woman.

The fact that she&#8217;s my high school crush just makes everything more magical.

To be honest, sometimes I feel like I am in a tv show for teens, like Dawson&#8217;s Creek or Beverly Hills 90210&#8230;

And now I am sitting here, in the house we are still decorating together, while she&#8217;s taking care of me ( I got high fever the day after the wedding ) and our pregnant cat meowing at us.

I love you, iLa.
