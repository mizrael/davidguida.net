Just a quick update: the folks from DevDay Salerno just uploaded the video from my <a href="https://www.davidguida.net/devday-salerno-lets-talk-about-feature-gating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feature gating talk</a> on Youtube! Unfortunately it&#8217;s in Italian but there are subtitles available ðŸ™‚

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

In case you still don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.davidguida.net/feature-gating-part-1-what-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a series</a> about Feature Gating, the next episode will be online soon!
