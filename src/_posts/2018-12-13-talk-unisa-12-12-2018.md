Every couple of weeks or so the University of Salerno hosts former students like me to talk a bit about their professional experience. Yesterday was my turn!

I was invited by my old teacher <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Great talk yesterday at the University of Salerno! I was invited by my old teacher Vittorio Scarano (hi prof!) to talk a bit about my professional experience.
