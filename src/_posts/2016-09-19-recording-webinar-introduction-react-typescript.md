Last Saturday I had the chance to run my first webinar, thanks to my friend and ex-colleague <a href="https://lalitkale.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lalit Kale</a> and the folks from <a href="http://www.indiamentor.com/" target="_blank">Indiamentor</a>.

We discussed about React, pros and cons, why should someone use it instead of AngularJS (for example eh, no puns intended) and how to setup the dev environment. Then I showed a small demo of a hello-world-like application made with Typescript using Visual Studio Code.

Later the same day, the Indiamentor team has also uploaded on Youtube the complete recording:

Unfortunately due to some obscure technical reasons, the streaming software decided to stop updating the screenshare after a couple of slides, so in the video you won&#8217;t see the second part of the presentation. However, I used Google Presentations to create my deck, so <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UvXtCtzSVpvi65iSLbS8CH7jZfCu3k86V8HVjqayGM0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the link </a>ðŸ™‚

I had a very good time preparing the slides and talking to the audience, even if I wasn&#8217;t actually seeing anyone. I am really starting to think that maybe I could prepare some coding or software architecture lessons and begin runningÂ some (online) courses.
