It all began with Silverlight. I mean, things lead to other things, and soon I started working on the Effect class&#8230; and soon I realized I needed some kind of shader editor, so I installed&nbsp;[Shazzam](http://shazzam-tool.com/). But Shazzam requires the DirectX SDK, so&#8230;

Now I remember why I love so much C++ ! It took me two weeks to fully remember the syntax, to learn the basics of the new DirectX 11 and to write a very basic renderer<img src="https://i1.wp.com/davideguida.netne.net/libs/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/thumbs_up.gif?w=788" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /> I've spent just half an hour every two/three days (late night programming sessions, of course), but it's funny to return to the origins. Well, at least I didn't start again with a spinning cube!

the model is from Elder Scroll 4: Oblivion, I've imported it in 3D Studio Max and exported in the old DirectX .x format, but I plan to switch soon to .fbx&#8230;Maybe in a month or two!
