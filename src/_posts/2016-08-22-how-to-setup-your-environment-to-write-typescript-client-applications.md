Hi all! This time I thought it could be useful to write down a couple of notes about how to setup your development environment ( in my case the wonderful <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> on Mac ) and start writingÂ Typescript applications.  
To be honest I am writing this only because my memory is becoming sloppy and I am getting lazier day after day ðŸ˜€

I created a <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/typescript_environment_setup" target="_blank">repo on GitHub</a> with the list of steps to perform and an example project.

In a nutshell you have to:  
1) create the project folder  
2) install a bunch of npm packages globally and locally  
3) initialize your project with npm init  
4) start coding ðŸ™‚

You will find all the details in the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/typescript_environment_setup/blob/master/readme.md" target="_blank">Readme.md</a>.

At the end of the process your dev environment will be configured to watch the /src/ folder for changes on .ts files, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_transpiling-typescript-into-javascript" target="_blank">transpile them into Javascript</a> and run a small web server.

Enjoy!
