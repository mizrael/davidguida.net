In the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been doing several experiments with Docker, just trying to grasp the main idea and maybe even come up with something useful.

As often happens with tools these days, there&#8217;s an entire world of command line tools that you should learn. 

OR you can just be lazy as me and keep a list of the most common ones ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ll be updating this list from time to time, just to keep track of what I&#8217;ve used so far and be a quick reference for my sloppy memory. 

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker login [HOST] # in case you need auth to pull or push images</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker build -t [TAG]</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker images # shows a list of the local images along with the size</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker push [TAG]</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) # this will remove ALL your containers. Be careful!</code></pre>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker system prune -a # this will remove ALL your images and containers. Very useful when you run low on space, but be careful!</code></pre>

The next command will display the Docker daemon logs, extremely useful when you don&#8217;t know what happened (basically me most of the time) and you&#8217;re looking for an answer, even if obscure. 

It depends on the OS you&#8217;re running on:

  * Ubuntu (old using upstart ) &#8211; `/var/log/upstart/docker.log`
  * Ubuntu (new using systemd ) &#8211; `sudo journalctl -fu docker.service`
  * Boot2Docker &#8211; `/var/log/docker.log`
  * Debian GNU/Linux &#8211; `/var/log/daemon.log`
  * CentOS &#8211; `/var/log/daemon.log | grep docker`
  * CoreOS &#8211; `journalctl -u docker.service`
  * Fedora &#8211; `journalctl -u docker.service`
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server &#8211; `/var/log/messages | grep docker`
  * OpenSuSE &#8211; `journalctl -u docker.service`
  * OSX &#8211; `~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/log/dâ€Œâ€‹ocker.log`
  * Windows &#8211; `Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Docker -After (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5) | Sort-Object Time`, as mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/troubleshooting#finding-logs).
