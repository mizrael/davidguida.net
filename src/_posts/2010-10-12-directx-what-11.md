    It&#8217;s just a quick update, nothing special&#8230;<br /> A friend of mine asked if I had some spare time to write a &#8220;not-so-technical&#8221; article on DirectX 11. He&#8217;s the admin of the Italian Civilization Blog, and they&#8217;re preparing for the new version of the game, so he thought it would be nice to share some infos about the new tech. Ssssooooo&#8230;. <a href="http://www.civilization5.it/?p=250">here&#8217;s the link,</a> I know, it&#8217;s in italian, but&#8230;well&#8230; ermmm&#8230;.. look at that, a three-headed monkey!

    Oh yes, I forgot to say. Two things.

  <p>
    First one, after a couple of days, the article got linked on the<a href="http://www.facebook.com/NVIDIAItalia?ref=nf"> nVidia Italian Facebook profile</a>. Yay!
  </p>

    Also, my friend has <a href="http://www.nvidia.it/object/gts450-civilization-contest-it.html">opened a contest</a> on his website (italian, yes), so if you own a copy of SidÂ Meier&#8217;s Whatever, you could win a GeForce GT450 !
