Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be speaking at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/devday-salerno/events/247341876/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly Meetup</a> hosted by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/devday-salerno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevDay Salerno</a> community! The topic of the day will be &#8220;**Feature Gating**&#8220;, I&#8217;ll talk about the general idea, use cases and best practices.&nbsp;The talk will be language-agnostic as this is more a **pattern** rather than a framework/library. I will show some code but try to keep the discussion more on the &#8220;theory-side&#8221;.&nbsp;

I have always been more attracted to **software architecture** and **design patterns** so I tend to avoid putting too much effort in whatever library is the hype of the moment.&nbsp;

Feature Gating is an interesting and easy tool to leverage when you want more flexibility during production deployment. It helps&nbsp;controlling and shipping new features faster allowing practices like&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canary releases</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B testing</a>.

One of the event organizers is an old friend of mine and ex coworker from my <a href="https://www.healthwareinternational.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthware</a>&nbsp;days. A while ago we discussed about having me presenting something but, as often happens, life stood in the way (along with me moving to a **different country** altogether).  
So as soon as I had the chance to plan ahead my trip back to Italy he managed to find a slot for me ðŸ™‚&nbsp;

Unfortunately the slides are in Italian so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll share them on this blog but I will be writing soon a more detailed post so stay tuned!

In the meantime, if you&#8217;re near Salerno and fancy a little geekiness <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=corso+Garibaldi+203%2C+Salerno%2C+sa%2C+meetup26%2C+it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come and say hi</a>!
